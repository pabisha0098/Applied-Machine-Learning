Hate Speech Detection on Twitter using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning–based text classification system to detect hate speech (racist or sexist content) in Twitter data. The goal is to automatically classify tweets as hate speech or non-hate speech using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques.

The project was developed as part of an academic coursework to demonstrate the application of text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and ethical considerations in NLP.

Problem Description

Hate speech on social media platforms can negatively impact individuals and communities. Due to the large volume of user-generated content, manual moderation is not scalable. This project addresses the problem by building an automated system capable of identifying hateful tweets to support content moderation efforts.

The task is formulated as a binary classification problem:

1 → Hate speech (racist or sexist)

0 → Non-hate speech
